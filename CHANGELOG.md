## 2018-06-04 ([#92](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/92))
## Added
- annotations for createdAt to include in json and annot. to exclude irrelevant properties like password and systemid
- OrganizationController
- OrganizationService and Impl
- OrganizationRepository and Impl
- endpoints for organization (getbyid, getall, save, update)
- enpoints for user (update)
## Changed
- mistake in OrganizationBuilder
- RBACRepository where the organization related things have been removed
- mappings and annotations in the UserImpl and OrganizationImpl entity classes
- some property namings which caused false naming convention in json
- organization in UserImpl to be ignored in json as it is causing an StackOverFlowError because it is runs into an 
endless recursion when showing employees of org. (when querying org.) and also showing employees when querying one user
and displaying organization property.
  - when querying a user, the `organization` property does not hold a property `employees` because of the mentioned error
  - when querying an organization, there is a property `employees` which holds all employees of the organization

## 2018-06-02 ([#92](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/92))
## Added
- Timestamp to the `createdAt` property of the `UserImpl` entity to have automatic timestamp creation
- new csv's in the folder `database_init` which are used when the property `rbac.system.service.authentication` is set
to `database`.
  - The csv's are inserting initial roles, rules and one admin user into the database
## Changed
- Changed database table names (annotations) of all entities from uppercase to lowercase
- UserImpl changed, where email is now unique
- RegistrationServiceDatabaseImpl changed where email is set as the systemId and special symbols are replaced with an underline
- RegistrationServiceDatabaseImpl changed where the default role of a newly registered user is set to 'USER'
- RBACConfig is now ALWAYS running the RBACRetrievalService
(as both database and memory strategy are performing an initial db insertion from csvs)
- RBACMappingService is now checking the property in the `applications.properties` file and depending on provided value, 
it gives the right path to the csv's (memoryusers or database_init folder)
- RBACRetrievalService is now getting the csvPath from the mappingService and is loading all rules,roles and users
- RBACRetrievalServiceMemoryImpl renamed to RBACRetrievalImpl as it is used for both strategies now

## 2018-06-02 ([#93](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/93))
## Added
- User-Details
    - Components are in ../pages/user-details
    - Displays User information
    - Contains test data
- Interceptor
    - Components are in ../@theme/components/auth/

    - Adds the current user token to every http request

## 2018-05-02 ([#89](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/89))
## Added
- Authentication
  - Components are in `@theme/auth`
  - Validation takes configuration from `app.module.ts` => `NbAuthModule/providers/forms/validation`
- Registration
  - Currently takes \[firstname, lastname, username, email, password\] to the backend endpoint /register
  - `NbAuthModule/providers/email/config` in `app.module.ts` is used to configure those endpoints
  - access via `/auth/registration`
- Roles
  - Utilizes special roles and rights management
  - Roles are currently assigned via the `role.provider.ts` which takes the first role from the token (issue)
  - `NbSecurityModule` in `app.module.ts` is used to configure rights
    - `view`, `create`, `remove` on role-level or `parent` to inherit rights
    - `*nbIsGranted="['view', 'user']"` is a condition the hides the element unless the user has the right `view` on `user`

## 2018-04-29 ([#79](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/79))
## Added
- register implemented
- register needs adaptations in terms of default role (tbd in corporation with Stefan L.)
- passwords are now hashed and compared by the hashes when logging-in (Bcrypt)
- endpoint added to send json with email attribute which checks if email already exists (async email validation)
  - send `POST` Method to `/user/register/checkIfMailTaken` with JSON containing `email` attribute
## Changed
- changed `application.properties` in Gateway service to fix problem with `RBACConfig` where it would not detect 
property `rbac.system.service`. Therefore, this property was changed to `rbac.system.service.authentication`
  - if set to `memory` then authentication via `CacheUser` is done and csvs are used
  - if set to `database` then authentication via database is done and NO csv and NO `CacheUser` is used
- moved `Condition` files to `config` folder in `Gateway/src/main/java/at/fhjoanneum/ippr/gateway/security/config`


## 2018-04-27 ([#77](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/77))
## Added
- new AuthenticationService in the Gateway parent service
  - named `AuthenticationServiceDatabaseImpl`
  - new service is used solely for logging-in users by ONLY checking if user
  with given `email` and `password` exists in the database
  - old `AuthenticationServiceMemoryImpl` still existent
  - added possibility to configure `rbac.system.service` in the `application.properties`
  of the `Gateway` service with the `database` option. (i.e. `database` option uses login
  via database check only and `memory` option uses `CacheUser` option)
## Changed
- `AuthenticationServiceMemoryImpl` now also uses the `email` attribute and not the `username`
- Payload class, which defines structure of received JSON when logging-in now (i.e. `UserLogin` in controller)
now uses `email` instead of `username`
- modified configuration classes for the `application.properties` file in the `Gateway` service
to allow for switching between `database` and `memory`
- adapted `RBACRetrievalServiceMemoryImpl` where csv is read into Map. Keys of map are now
the users `email` instead of `username` (needed for log-in with email instead of username)


## 2018-04-26 ([#74](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/74))
## Added
- complete GUI replacement: new GUI based on ngx-admin

  - `ProcessStore`
  - `Rating`
  - `Review`
## Changed

  - added fields email, password, organization (FK), createdAt
-`UserBuilder.java`

- `ProcessEngineCallerImpl.java`
  - made `getUser` and `appendUserInformation` to remove ErrorMsg from GateWayLog

## 2018-04-23 ([#67](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/67))
## Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` file for the whole project
  - should allow to quickly look up all changes and for further information reference to the PR and the associated files


## 2018-04-23 ([#64](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/64))
## Added
- `postcss.config.js` in `GUI-dev` for a module to function properly (more or less) 
## Changed
- fixed dependencies and errors with npm packages
- modified some module versions in `package.json`


## 2018-04-07 ([#59](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/59))
## Added
- added note in readme for zsh users to change to bash and how to do this.
- also added note that the zsh shell is not recommended at all
## Changed
- start.sh was modified and dynamic variables are used now in applescript for delays.                       
- argument parser was modified and the dev mode argument has changed. This was also changed in the README.
## Removed 
- the custom applescript in the start.sh does not work well with zsh as delays are too short and else it takes too long to execute. 
- Therefore, **zsh support is dropped**.


## 2018-04-04 ([#55](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/55))
## Changed
- Updated README.md.
  - General info added for repo and the intention of the fork
  - Added instructions on how to set-up docker container for mysql
  - Added instructions on how to execute all services by using either the start.bat or start.sh scripts
  - Explained how to enable/disable the example processes which were discussed in the PR #54.
  - Added further description and instructions on how to completely enable/disable the example processes.- added gradlew.bat, gradle-wrapper.properties to .gitignore
- Adapted the start.sh and start.bat scripts:- activated example processes as described in chapter 5 of the master thesis; therefore start_configuration_service is deactivated in start.sh and start.bat
  - Both scripts now support dev mode or normal mode. This allows for skipping the execution of the ConfigurationService to use the example processes.  - tested both example processes - both worked well - no db query errors for the moment


## 2018-03-30 ([#54](https://github.com/amarbajric/EBUSA-AIM17/pull/54))
## Added
- added gradlew.bat, gradle-wrapper.properties to .gitignore
